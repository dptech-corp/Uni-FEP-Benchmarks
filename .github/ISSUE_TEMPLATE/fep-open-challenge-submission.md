## 🏆 FEP Open Challenge Submission

### 📌 Test Case Summary
_Provide a brief description of your test case._
> Example: This test case evaluates Uni-FEP's accuracy in predicting binding affinities for kinase inhibitors.

### 📝 Source Data
_Provide the source of your dataset (e.g., literature, in-house experimental data, etc.)._
> Example: DOI of the original paper or mention if it's unpublished data.


### 📂 Data Files
#### 📁 1. Protein Structure File (PDB)
_Upload or link to the PDB file containing the protein structure._
- **File Name:** `[Insert file name]`
- **Description:** _Provide details about the protein structure (e.g., resolution, source, modifications, binding pocket information)._
> Example: "PDB structure from PDB ID: 6LU7, modified to include missing loops."

#### 📁 2. Reference Ligand File (SDF)
_Upload or link to the SDF file containing the reference ligand._
- **File Name:** `[Insert file name]`
- **Description:** _Describe the reference ligand (e.g., known binder, co-crystalized ligand, binding mode)._
> Example: "Reference ligand extracted from PDB 6LU7, used to define the binding pocket."

#### 📁 3. Data File (CSV/SDF)
_Upload or link to the dataset file (CSV containing SMILES and experimental activity, or SDF containing experimental data)._
- **File Name:** `[Insert file name]`
- **Description:** _Explain the content (e.g., ligand structures, experimental binding affinities, logIC50/IC50 values)._
> Example: "CSV file with experimental IC50 values from published dataset (DOI: xxx)."


### 🔢 Estimated Number of Perturbation Pairs
_How many perturbation pairs do you expect to calculate?_
> Example: ~20 perturbation pairs.

### 📬 Additional Comments
