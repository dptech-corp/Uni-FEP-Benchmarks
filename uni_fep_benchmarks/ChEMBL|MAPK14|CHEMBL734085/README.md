## Introduction

MAPK14, also known as p38α, is a mitogen-activated protein kinase that plays a major role in the regulation of inflammatory responses, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and autophagy. As part of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, MAPK14 is activated by environmental stresses, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and growth factors, integrating signaling events that are fundamental to normal cell function and pathological conditions. MAPK14 has been extensively studied as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer due to its central role in immune response and inflammation.

The FEP calculation results for the MAPK14 system showed strong predictive performance, with an R² of 0.68 and an RMSE of 1.42 kcal/mol. Several ligands demonstrated outstanding predictive accuracy between experimental and FEP-calculated binding free energies. For instance, CHEMBL103667 exhibited excellent agreement, with an experimental binding free energy of -12.12 kcal/mol and a predicted value of -12.08 kcal/mol. Similarly, CHEMBL318810 showed close alignment, with an experimental binding free energy of -11.28 kcal/mol and predicted free energy of -11.29 kcal/mol. 

The predicted binding free energy values generally aligned with the relative binding trends observed experimentally, showcasing the capability of FEP calculation methods to support MAPK14-targeted drug discovery efforts.
