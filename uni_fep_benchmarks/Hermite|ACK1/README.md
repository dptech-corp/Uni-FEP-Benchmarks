## Introduction

Activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 (ACK1) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays important roles in cell survival, migration, and cancer progression. It is activated by multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and has been implicated in various cancers, including prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancer. ACK1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in oncology due to its involvement in multiple signaling pathways that promote tumor growth and metastasis, with inhibitors showing potential in preclinical studies.

## Molecules

The ACK1 system dataset in this study consists of 6 compounds, featuring furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine and pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine core structures. The compounds share a common cyclopropylmethyl amine substituent and demonstrate structural diversity through different heterocyclic core modifications and biphenyl substituents. Notable structural features include variations in the central heterocyclic system that influence binding affinity.

The experimentally determined binding free energies span a range from -6.82 to -11.22 kcal/mol, representing a significant range of binding affinities that covers nearly 4.5 orders of magnitude in terms of binding constants.

## Conclusions

<p align="center"><img src="result_dG.png" width="300"></p>

The FEP calculation results for the ACK1 system show good correlation with experimental data, achieving an RÂ² of 0.71 and an RMSE of 1.10 kcal/mol. Several compounds demonstrated good prediction accuracy, such as compound 2 (experimental: -10.91 kcal/mol, predicted: -10.24 kcal/mol) and compound 4 (experimental: -7.01 kcal/mol, predicted: -7.37 kcal/mol). The predicted binding free energies ranged from -7.37 to -10.24 kcal/mol, effectively capturing the relative binding trends of the series.
