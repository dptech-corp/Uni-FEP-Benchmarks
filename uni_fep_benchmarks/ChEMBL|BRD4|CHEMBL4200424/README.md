## Introduction

BRD4 (Bromodomain-containing protein 4) is a member of the BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) protein family. It plays a key role in transcriptional regulation and acts as a master regulator of chromatin interactions. BRD4 has been implicated in numerous human cancers and inflammatory diseases due to its ability to bind acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, thereby recruiting transcriptional machinery to active gene loci. As such, it has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the development of novel cancer treatments, particularly in aggressive and therapy-resistant cancers.

## Molecules
