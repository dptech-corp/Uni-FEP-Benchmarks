## Introduction

Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the G1/S transition. In complex with cyclin D, CDK4 phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), leading to cell cycle progression. Dysregulation of the CDK4/cyclin D pathway is a common feature in many cancers, particularly breast cancer. CDK4 inhibitors have emerged as an important class of targeted therapeutics, with several compounds approved for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.

## Molecules

The CDK4 system dataset in this study consists of 6 compounds, featuring a complex bicyclic core structure with various substituents. The compounds share a common tetrahydrofuran-pyrimidine scaffold and demonstrate structural diversity through different modifications, including halogen substitutions and various amine-containing side chains. Notable structural features include the presence of N-alkylated heterocycles and strategically placed hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.

The experimentally determined binding free energies span a range from -9.59 to -12.22 kcal/mol, representing a significant range of binding affinities that covers nearly 3 orders of magnitude in terms of binding constants.

## Conclusions

The FEP calculation results for the CDK4 system show excellent correlation with experimental data, achieving an R² of 0.84 and an RMSE of 0.38 kcal/mol. Several compounds demonstrated remarkable prediction accuracy, such as compound 6 (experimental: -10.86 kcal/mol, predicted: -10.85 kcal/mol) and compound 4 (experimental: -9.59 kcal/mol, predicted: -9.49 kcal/mol). The predicted binding free energies ranged from -9.49 to -12.33 kcal/mol, effectively capturing the relative binding trends of the series.
